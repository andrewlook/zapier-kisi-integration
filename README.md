# zapier-kisi-integration

This is a custom zapier action, so in-person businesses using Kisi's lock manager can create a Zapier workflow to periodically update their occupancy rate on their websites (by saving the results to their CMS).

## Setup

Follow the steps in the [Zapier Platform CLI Tutorial](https://platform.zapier.com/quickstart/cli-tutorial) to get started and learn how to work with custom actions.

```
npm install -g zapier-platform-cli

zapier login
```


## Usage

To test the integrations, create a file `.env` in this repository (that won't be saved to github) with the following contents:

```

KISI_API_KEY=...

# sample place ID for testing
KISI_PLACE_ID=... 
```

> Note: see [here](https://docs.kisi.io/how_to_guides/account_and_organization/generate_api_key/) for how to generate a Kisi API key.

To run the tests:

```
zapier test
```

To push any updated actions/triggers and make them available (privately to your account) in Zapier:

```
zapier push
```
